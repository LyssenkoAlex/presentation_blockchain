Slide 1. 
Blockchain basics.
The hype around blockchain is massive. To hear the blockchain hype train tell it, blockchain will now:

1.	Solve income inequality
2.	Make all data secure forever
3.	Make everything much more efficient 

What the heck is a blockchain, anyway? And can it really do all these things? Can blockchain bring something amazing to industries as diverse as health care, finance, supply chain management and music rights?

Slide 2.
What is a blockchain?

To examine some of these claims, we have to define what a blockchain is and herein lies a lot of the confusion. Many companies use the word “blockchain” to mean some sort of magical device by which all their data will never be wrong. Such a device, of course, does not exist, at least when the real world is involved.

So what is a blockchain? Technically speaking, a blockchain is a linked list of blocks and a block is a group of ordered transactions. If you didn’t understand the last sentence, you can think of a blockchain as a subset of a database, with a few additional properties.

The main thing distinguishing a blockchain from a normal database is that there are specific rules about how to put data into the database. That is, it cannot conflict with some other data that’s already in the database (consistent), it’s append-only (immutable), and the data itself is locked to an owner (ownable), it’s replicable and available. Finally, everyone agrees on what the state of the things in the database are (canonical) without a central party (decentralized).

It is this last point that really is the holy grail of blockchain. Decentralization is very attractive because it implies there is no single point of failure. That is, no single authority will be able to take away your asset or change “history” to suit their needs. This immutable audit trail where you don’t have to trust anyone is the benefit that everyone that’s playing with this technology is looking for. This benefit, however, come at a great cost.

Slide 3.
To be aware of.
Development 
Creating a provably consistent system is not an easy task. A small bug could corrupt the entire database or cause some databases to be different than other ones. Of course, a corrupted or split database no longer has any consistency guarantees. Furthermore, all such systems have to be designed from the outset to be consistent. There is no “move fast and break things” in a blockchain. If you break things, you lose consistency and the blockchain becomes corrupted and worthless.

You may be thinking, why can’t you just fix the database or start over and move on? That would be easy enough to do in a centralized system, but this is very difficult in a decentralized one. You need consensus, or the agreement of all players in the system, in order to change the database. The blockchain has to be a public resource that’s not under the control of a single entity (decentralized, remember?), or the entire effort is a very expensive way to create a slow, centralized database.

Slide 4.
User role.
Users are sovereign
This can be really good as companies don’t like the liability of having user data in the first place. This can be bad, however, if the user is “misbehaving”. There’s no way to kick out the user that’s spamming your blockchain with frivolous data or has figured out a way to profit in some fashion that causes other users lots of inconvenience. This is related to the above observation that incentive structures have to be designed really, really well in that a user that figures out an exploit is not likely to give that up, especially if there’s profit for the user.
You may be thinking that you can simply refuse service to malicious users, which would be very easy to do in a centralized service. However, unlike a centralized service, refusing service is difficult because no single entity has the authority to kick anyone out. The blockchain has to be impartial and enforce the rules defined by the software. If the rules are insufficient to deter bad behavior, you’re out of luck. There is no “spirit” of the law here. You simply have to deal with malicious or misbehaving actors, possibly for a very long time.


All upgrades are voluntary
A forced upgrade is not an option. The other players on the network have no obligation to change to your software. If they did, such a system would be much easier, faster and cheaper to build as a centralized system. The point of a blockchain is that it’s not under the control of a single entity and this is violated with a forced upgrade.
Instead, all upgrades have to be backwards-compatible. This is obviously quite difficult, especially if you want to add new features and even harder when thinking from a testing perspective. Each version of the software adds a lot to the test matrix and lengthens the time to release.

Keep in mind.
Blockchain is a popular term these days and unfortunately. If you are a centralized service, a blockchain doesn’t get you anything that you can’t do a thousand times cheaper with a centralized database. If you are a decentralized service, then you’re probably fooling yourself and not thinking about the single points of failure that exist in your system. There wouldn’t be a “you” at all in a truly decentralized service.

Some Gartner trends.
The graph shows that many modern industries are trying to use blockchain to solve their production problems, and every year new industries appear that begin to explore blockchain.
However, so far no industry has reached a plateau of productivity or even a slope of enlightenment.

Of course, not all industries that are now on their way to the peak of expectations will reach the plateau of productivity, but judging by the mass movement, in 5-10 we will witness the widespread use of a number of cases.



Most modern blockchain technologies are also on the wave of discussion. But not because these are new technologies, but because industries are examining them for applicability to their data structure, the volume and speed of their processing, they are looking for ways to use blockchain technology to increase efficiency and reduce costs.


Have you heard anything about Amara’s law? 
“We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.”
There was a time when long distance phone calls were very expensive with terrible quality and reliability. Now look what you cellphone does for you and what you can do with your cell phone.
What you and other people criticizing the current state and application of this technology fail to understand is the influence of new technologies on one another in creating new applications
and their practicality. The executives that are already thinking about implementing blockchain will be a few steps ahead of the ones that don’t because they understand the difference between
solving short term issues vs. having a long term plan for future needs.
